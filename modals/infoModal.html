                <strong>Pages Store Links</strong>
                <p>Each page is a list of links. Anyone can view or add to it.</p>

                <strong>No Ownership- No Accounts</strong>
                <p>No one owns pagesâ€”anyone with the name has full access. No user data is stored when posting.</p>

                <strong>Links Are Permanent</strong>

                <p>A common name <code>/funnyvideos</code> is easy to guess. A random one <code>/b7Qx9fL2</code> is
                    nearly impossible to find.</p>
